# MAIZE IS IN MAINTENANCE MODE 

Maize's original repo has been archived and there were some bugs so I forked it and fixed a couple of them.

Any further development here will mostly be bug fixes.

# Acknowledgments 🌟
A big thank you to [**Cobmin**](https://github.com/jacobhuberdotme), the original creator of this amazing tool. All credit should go to him! Loopring and it's NFT ecosystem would be very different without Maize.💙

From myself and the Loopring community we appreciate all of the work you put into this 🙏
